# AgileSoftwareModel-File Processor
This branch of the repository contains a tool that is used for sampling the results that are obtained from different employees.
considering that the system records the progress in the skill areas of employees each time that they pick and finish a task, the timestamps that are recorded in the statistic files are not synchronized. The tool in this branch samples information from the provided statistic files, but it requires its maximum threshold, and the sampling steps/offsets to be specified manually!
